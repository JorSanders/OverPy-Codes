# Overwatch workshop files

These are files used for custom games in OverWatch2.
You will need [OverPy](https://pypi.org/project/overpy/) to compile these into in game usable settings

## Folder structure

- 'Existing codes' Contains decompiled verions of other peoples codes. (Mostly used to reverse engineer)
- 'Jorkol' Contains contains codes updated or created by me.
